# More Details
Have you ever wanted a talking house? Now you can! With my Big Talker SmartApp ( http://github.com/rayzurbock/SmartThings-BigTalker )

When SmartThings is paired with a compatible audio device (such as a Sonos, Ubi or VLC Thing ( http://community.smartthings.com/t/vlc-thing-a-poor-mans-sonos/5433 )) and Big Talker SmartApp, your house can say what you want it to say when events occur.

Currently supported events:

* **Time**, Time of Day + Day(s) of Week
* **Motion**, Active/Inactive
* **Switch**, On/Off
* **Presence**, Arrive/Depart
* **Lock**, Lock/Unlock
* **Contact**, Open/Close
* **Mode**, Change (Home, Away, etc)
* **Thermostat**, Cooling/Heating/Fan/Idle(not running)
* **Acceleration**, Active/Inactive
* **Water**, Wet/Dry
* **Smoke**, Detect/Clear/Test
* **Button**,  Press

Each supported event supports 3 different groups so that you can alter your spoken phrases based on which group your selection of devices is configured in.

Voice phrases support the following variables (to be filled in at runtime)

* **%devicename%** = Triggering devices display name
* **%devicetype%** = Triggering device type; motion, switch, etc...
* **%devicechange%** = State change that occurred; on/off, active/inactive, etc...
* **%locationname%** = Hub Location name; home, work, etc...
* **%lastmode%** = Last home mode; home, away, etc...
* **%mode%** = Current home mode; home, away, etc...
* **%time%** = Current time; HH:mm am/pm
* **%weathercurrent%** = Current weather (from Weather Underground; based on SmartThings Hub Zipcode)
* **%weathertoday%** = Today's weather (from Weather Underground; based on SmartThings Hub Zipcode)
* **%weathertonight%** = Tonight's weather (from Weather Underground; based on SmartThings Hub Zipcode)
* **%weathertomorrow%** = Tomorrow's weather (from Weather Underground; based on SmartThings Hub Zipcode)

For example when turning off a switch named "Office Light" with a spoken phrase of "*%devicename% %devicetype% has been turned %devicechange%*" would speak "*Office light switch has been turned off*"

Keep in mind, if you configure highly active or too many devices, it may get annoying!! We had a family gathering tonight and the kids kept going in/out the back door to play in the yard. "Back Door has been opened, Back Door has been closed, Back Door has been opened, you get the idea." I wouldn't configure chatty motion sensors either, but that's up to you.

***Have Fun!***

# Revision History
*  12/13/2014 - 1.0.0 - Initial Release
*  12/17/2014 - 1.0.1 - Sonos Support corrected. Resume playback after speaking (not supported for VLC-Thing until the Device Type supports it), Corrected custom speech device save for Switch events, general cleanup.  More event support to come in new releases soon. Special thanks to SmartThings community member Greg for help with testing Sonos functionality and making this release possible.
*  12/26/2014 - 1.0.2 - Corrected bug where Sonos would show up to be selected as a default speech device, but not as a custom speech device for each device/event group.
*  3/4/2015 - 1.1.0
  * Feature: New sensor event handlers
    * Acceleration (active/inactive) event
    * Water (wet/dry) event added
    * Smoke (detected/clear/tested) event 
    * Button (press) event added, to be tested..., Need someone to test.
  * Feature: Mode change exclusion: Remain silent when changed to a configured mode, when coming from an excluded mode.  Thanks for the request SmartThingsCommunity:Greg.
  * Feature: Added default "talk while in mode(s)" with custom mode overrides for each event group.
  * Feature: Added Volume Change (supported for Sonos, VLC-Thing, not supported for Ubi due to lack of support in it's device type)
  * Feature: Toggle support for either capability.musicPlayer(Sonos/VLCThing) or capability.speechSynthesis(Ubi/VLCThing).  Note: Only one type or the other is currently configurable in the app at a time.
    * Install the app twice to support both modes.
  * Feature: Optional: Default Allowed Talk Time, with per event group override. (Thanks ST Community: Greg for the idea)
  * Feature: Added Talk Now feature (once the app is properly setup/configured, it will show up on the main page under Status and Configure).
  * Feature: Added scheduled event based on time of day and day(s) of the week.  Only allowed 3 as ST apps are only allowed 4 schedules at a time, so I'm reserving 1 for future/internal use (Thanks ST Community: Greg for the feature request)
  * Feature Modification: Adjusted some debug/trace log info
  * Feature Modification: Status page: add defaults, cleanup look
  * Feature Modification: Configuration flow change (to better support the choice of musicPlayer / speechSynthesis)
  * Feature Modification: Default text is shown in Group 1 of each device type as an example; if the user deletes the text and saves, it reappears the next time they edit the event type. This modification only fills the default text if the speech text is blank AND the device list is empty.  (Thanks for the feedback ST Community: Greg)
  * Feature Modification: Added time scheduled events to the status page
  * Feature Modification: Added phrase variable %time% which will return the current time.
  * BugFix: VLCThing reporting "stopped" instead of "disconnected" therefore it was calling "playTextAndResume" and cutting off phrases.  Adjusted to playText if no trackdata found.
  * BugFix: Switch Group 3 was not working.  onSwitch3Event() function missing; Added.  Thanks GitHub @roblandry (Issue #5).
  * BugFix: Ensure Uninstall button is always on the "Configure" page, even for partially installed instances
  * BugFix: Mode change announcement may announce previous mode incorrectly.  Resolved.
  * BugFix: Hopefully fixed a bug where upgrading from versions before 1.0.3-Beta1 speechDevice selections may show up as a text field; toggling Sonos/Ubi support resolved, so added code to try to prevent the issue to start with (Thanks ST Community: Greg for the report)
  * BugFix: When attempting to configure a "motion" event user receives the message "Error:You are not authorized to perform the requested operation" (Thanks: ST:chaaad614)
  * BugFix(attempt; needs testing): Under capability.musicPlayer Talk() calls playTextAndResume() even when it detects that nothing was playing before speaking. Changed to playTextAndRestore() when nothing is previously playing. Thanks for the report ST Community:Kristopher
  * BugFix: Fixed an issue where custom talk modes were not checked when using a scheduled Time event.
  * BugFix: Fixed an issue where current day of the week was not calculated properly for a scheduled Time event causing these events to speak on days of the week that were not desired.
  * BugFix: Fixed an issue where "Talk Now" would sometimes say the last spoken phrase upon entering the "Talk Now" page.
*  10/25/2015 - 1.1.1
  * BugFix: Corrected issue with Motion 1 announcement custom time restrictions
*  10/25/2015 - 1.1.2
  * BugFix: Corrected issue with setting speech volume. Ensure that Volume is not 0; Set to 75 if it is.
*  10/26/2015 - 1.1.3
  * BugFix: Added additional check in Talk() if using MusicPlayer device, currentTrack = null and currentStatus was "playing" then BT would not "resume", but instead would stop the track, PlayText() and not resume the track.
  * BugFix: Replaced deprecated "refreshAfterSelection" in dynamic pages with replacement "submitOnChange". This fixes things like TalkNow's expected operation.  
  * Feature Enhancement: Additional logging added in Talk()
* 11/8/2015 - 1.1.4-Beta1
  * Metadata Update: Update Copyright from 2014 to 2014-2015
  * Feature Modification:  Re-write of Talk() to better detect latest playing track and play status (latestValue() instead of currentValue()).
  * BugFix:  Corrected default phrases for Water sensor (Thanks ST Community: Greg) (was using acceleration phrases)
  * BugFix:  Corrected home mode change issue if exclusion was not set (Thanks for the report ST Community: Greg)
  * New Feature:  poll() or refresh() on Talk() to try to update current status of player.  Protect crash using try/catch routines.
  * New Feature:  Added detection of failure to convert text to speech (SmartThings intermittent issue with textToSpeech function), send notification instead so message is not missed.
  * New Feature:  Added new Talk variables %weathercurrent%, %weathertoday%, %weathertonight%, %weathertomorrow%.  Can be added to any event.
* 11/9/2014 - 1.1.4-Beta2
  * BugFix:  Resolve an error that is present if both currentTrack and currentStatus return null. "java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot get property 'status' on null object"
